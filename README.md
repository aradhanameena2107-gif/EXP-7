AIM: To study of loops in Python

THEORY:

A loop in Python is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition becomes false. Loops help automate repetitive tasks and make programs efficient.

Python mainly provides two types of loops:

- for loop — used when the number of iterations is known

- while loop — used when the number of iterations is not known in advance

This program focuses on the while loop.
